# searchIng
Simple extension that popup a search bar to navigate through Siding pages

## TODO:

- [  ] Hardcoded webscrapper's chrome's driver
- [  ] Make the search bar an actual popup, so it renders in the middle of the browser (make it fancy)
- [  ] Extend the link webscrapping to others IngUC pages (that are hard to navigate)
- [  ] Determine which is the best algorithm to match sentences by input string on the run and progressive (so it does not need to redo the filtering)
- [  ] Make it portable to all browser or at least most popular ones
